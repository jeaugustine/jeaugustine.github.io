<h1>Academic Honesty</h1>
</div>
<p>This page documents my expectation of academic honesty on the part of students who take my courses in theoretical computer science. On occasion, I teach courses (for e.g., CS1100) which are more general CS courses for which my expectations may be different. When in doubt, do not make assumptions; <a href="contact.html">please ask</a>.</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>I assign problem sets so that you can get some initial experience in solving problems. I am aware that learning to solving problems is more fruitful when you work with friends. So I allow you to &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; assignment problems with your friends and fellow students. You are expected to write your own answers.</p>
<p>If you have discussed the problem with anybody, you should mention them explicitly. You can make a statement such as &ldquo;this problem was solved in collaboration with Alice, Bob, and Eve.&rdquo; Although not required, you can also be more specific and thank specific collaborators who hit upon the right idea. Such acknowledgements will <b><i>not</i></b> affect your marks in any way.</p>
<h2>In-Class Quizzes and Exams</h2>
<p>I often (but not always) allow you to bring one A4 size sheet of paper on which you could have handwritten anything. (Photocopies of your friend's sheet will not be allowed.) As you take the time to study and understand the material, I suggest that you make note of definitions, theorems, formulas, etc. that have pesky details that &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; though not crucial to your understanding &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; are crucial to solving problems correctly.</p>
<p>Other than that, you are not allowed to take the help of any other source of information.</p>
<h2>Take-Home Quizzes and Exams</h2>
<p>You are allowed to consult your own notebook and standard textbooks. You are not allowed to consult any other source of information. You are not allowed to discuss with anybody regardless of whether they are affiliated with IIT Madras or not. You are also not allowed to post assignment/test problems in online forums or search for solutions in the Internet or any other electronic media. (The exception is that you are allowed to refer to standard textbooks available in the Internet through portals such as Google books.)</p>
<p>You must acknowledge any textbook that you referred.</p>
<h2>Penalty</h2>
<p>I will not hesitate to take matters to the disciplinary committee when the situation calls for it.</p>
