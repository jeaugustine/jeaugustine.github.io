<h1>Postdoctoral position hosted by John Augustine</h1>
</div>
<p>A postdoctoral position is available in the <a href="http://ccd.cse.iitm.ac.in/">Cryptography Cybersecurity and Distributed Trust (CCD)</a> group at IIT Madras. The position will be hosted by <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~augustine/">John Augustine</a> and the work (broadly speaking) will be on secure distributed computing. There will be significant freedom to explore problems within this broad framework. There will be a strong emphasis on publishing at top venues in distributed computing theory and theoretical computer science at large.</p>
<p>The candidate is expected to have doctoral experience in theoretical computer science and must have published in established venues within TCS. Candidates with experience in randomized algorithms, distributed algorithms, online and approximation algorithms, complexity theory (particularly communication complexity), and other established TCS topics are encouraged to apply. Interested candidates are requested to <a href="contact.html">send</a> their CV and names/emails of two references. The covering email should contain a brief statement about the candidate's research accomplishments and interests.</p>
<p>The position is for one year (starting immediately) and extendable depending on mutual consent and availability of funds. The salary will be commensurate with similar positions within established institutions in India. </p>
<p>NOTE: Due to the prevailing pandemic, the successful candidate may be required to start on a work-from-home basis, but will be expected to come to IIT Madras once it is deemed safe.</p>
