<td align="left"><p>Hello! I am a faculty member in the <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/">computer science and engineering</a> department at <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">IIT Madras</a>. I focus primarily on distributed trust dealing with trust issues in distributed settings. I am keen on applying distributed trust principles to a variety of contexts ranging from classical distributed computing (CONGEST/LOCAL models, congested clique, node capacitated clique, etc.), mobile agents, machine learning, blockchains, etc.</p>
<h2>Hiring !!!</h2>
<p>I am actively looking for self-motivated postdocs and MS/PhD scholars. </p>
<p><b>Postdoctoral Position.</b> If you have completed (or about to complete) your PhD in theoretical aspects of computer science and would like to explore problems in secure distributed computing, please <a href="contact.html">reach out to me</a>. Here is some <a href="21-postdoc.html">more information about the position</a>.</p>
<p><b>MS/PhD Positions.</b> If you are interested in doing your MS or PhD with me, please consider formally applying via the <a href="https://research.iitm.ac.in/">institute</a>.
